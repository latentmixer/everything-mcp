# Changelog

All notable changes to **everything-mcp** will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Multi-term AND queries (e.g. `dm:today ext:md`) now return results: the query is split into separate es.exe arguments in `search()` (#2, contributed by @Zouxd2004) and in `count()` / `get_total_size()` so `everything_count_stats` works too (#4).
- `total_size` no longer overflows to `18446744073709551615` ("16384.0 PB"): the es.exe unsigned `-1` error sentinel is now reported as "Total size not available" (#4).
- A wrong `EVERYTHING_INSTANCE` no longer breaks the server: the connection falls back to instance auto-detection with a warning, error messages explain when the variable is actually needed, and the README no longer suggests setting `EVERYTHING_INSTANCE=1.5a` for all 1.5 users (#5).

### Added

- Claude Code plugin marketplace support: `/plugin marketplace add elis132/everything-mcp`, then `/plugin install everything-mcp@everything-mcp`.
- Bundled `everything-search` skill for Claude Code: query syntax reference, tool selection guidance, and common pitfalls.
- CI workflow (pytest on Ubuntu/Windows for Python 3.10/3.13, ruff check/format) and `.gitattributes` line-ending normalization.
- Release pipeline triggered by version tags: builds, creates the GitHub release, publishes to PyPI (trusted publishing), and publishes to the official MCP registry (`io.github.elis132/everything-mcp`).
- Manual live smoke test workflow that runs the backend against a real Everything instance on a Windows runner.
- Dependabot updates for GitHub Actions and pip.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-04

### Changed

- Updated README badge URLs with cache-busting query params to force fresh badge values on GitHub and PyPI.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-04

### Changed

- Replaced em-dash punctuation with ASCII hyphens (`-`) across docs and source text.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-04

### Changed

- Updated package metadata author to `elis132` (removed author email from PyPI metadata).
- Updated LICENSE copyright holder name to `elis132`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed

- Fixed `everything_count_stats` reporting `0` for `total_count` and `total_size` on some systems.
- Updated backend aggregate queries to avoid incompatible `es.exe` flag combinations (`-n 0` with `-get-result-count` / `-get-total-size`).
- Added backend tests to verify aggregate command construction.
